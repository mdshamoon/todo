# Todo App

This is a simple todo app on the web that does not store your data anywhere in the database. It uses localhost to store your data. So your todo's will always be available on your system. 

I use it quite frequently for writing my todo's since I was not able to find a simple todo app that just does exacly one thing. Write my todo's without the need to see so many other great features.

I used to write todo's earlier in notes app in my Mac but it also got messy after writing so many notes over time.
